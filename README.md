This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where the type system doesn't catch a runtime error. The function 'add' is declared to accept two numbers and return a number. However, it's called with two strings. TypeScript doesn't stop this because string concatenation is also an operation that makes the code compile without any warning. This will lead to unexpected results in the code, which can be hard to detect. A solution is proposed in the bugSolution file.
